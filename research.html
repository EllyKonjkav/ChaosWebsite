        <div class="col-12 col-lg-12">
                <p class="lead">Hi! My name is <b><i>Elly</i></b> and I've been a life long foodie. A few years ago, I started seeing an uprising of something that I called Characuterie board/buffet on steroids! It was captivatingly beautiful and the idea to have food set out at all at once and everyone can just "graze" as they please was a game changer! A whole party where people can snack non-stop, what could possibly be better? I have always been a huge entertainer, having parties almost weekly. I have always been the person that would bring food to every event, always from scratch. When I lived in Singapore, I also had a small catering business. You get it, I have always loved food and people. It was 2 years ago when I saw my first ever grazing board on Instagram, from someone in Australia. This trend had started in New Zealand and Australia and it was catching on around the world. Besides the visual beauty, it was a great idea for caterers because you actually use less ingredients in the long run. Why do I say in the long run? If you are doing it at home and you don't entertain often, you will be buying up so many ingredients only to use a bit of everything and leaving a lot of leftovers that could go stale, rendering them useless and leaving a lot of food waste on your hands. But if you are big entertainer and or a catering business, you will save a lot money because you use lesser quantity of each ingredient - since you would be spreading things out, you will inevitably be using less. There is a huge misconception that creating a grazing board/platter or table is easy because you just cut everything and throw it on there. However, this is the farthest thing from the truth. You need to practice <b><i>a lot</i></b> before you can master it. I started my very first platter in a friendly evening with my girlfriends (<i>top left picture below - 2018</i>) and as you can see, it was a rough start, but a start nonetheless! I still did the job and everyone was in awe and it was a great conversation piece. I had wine and the board in the middle which allowed us to graze and talk till 5am. I would say that's a successful party by any standard. I then became very interested in this style of entertaining, so I made it every chance I got and I started to follow more Instagram stars and paid attention to the details to get more inspiration. And with practice, and a year and a half of difference, you can see how much I improved (<i>top right picture below - 2019</i>)
                </p>
            
            <p class="lead text-muted">
                Now let's talk about the most impactful presentation, the grazing table! Now this is another level of amazing. It makes people stop in their tracks and just take it all in. Eating suddenly becomes infinitely more fun, because it's also a teasure hunt. What shall we eat first? What IS everything? What goes with what? The possibilities become endless, mixing and matching. I am a big fan of entire meals on a grazing table. As a person who usually entertains large groups of people, I am constantly running around and doing stuff the entire time. I am also Iranian/Russian and we cook for 20 when we have 2 guests, so you can imagine the pain of large parties and a small apartment. Appetisers, main meal and then dessert. By the end of the day I am too exhaused and have not eaten anything. That's not the most ideal for me because I won't enjoy the party at all. Enter full mean grazing tables, now this is a BEAST of work. It takes so much before hand preparation and many many hours of planning ahead. BUT, once you do all of that, you are completely free to enjoy the entire party with everyone else. People can choose to have dessert first, main course last, or yo-yo betweeen all of them. Every single party that's been like this has been a huge success and I don't go to bed hungry. Just to show you the huge difference in wow factor, look at the pictures below. The <i>bottom left picture</i> is my husband's 30th birthday where I cooked and slaved over 3 days straight and it was beautiful in it's own accord. Then look at <i>bottom right picture</i>, my husband's 35th birthday. Isn't that just beautiful? Everyone ate for 8 hours straight with so much dancing and laughter. To say it was memorable is an understatement!

I added the pictures in a 2 rows, with 12 columns in each row, and each picture occupying 6 columns. I made sure to use display block of width 100 to utilize the entire space for the pictures. I also added my own custom style css to make the rows look more pleasing. -->

                <p class="lead">To come to a closing on the art of grazing, I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone who loves cooking, baking, entertaining or if you have a catering business. There is definitely a learning curve, but nothing that can't be overcomed with some practice. I would recommend starting from smaller platters and using a round board because it is easier to pull off. Don't be like me and start from a big board, it is HARD! But then I am a "go big or go home" kind of gal. Watch a ton of videos, look at pictures and pay attention to all the small details. How are the different cheeses cut? How are the fruits cut? What colours are used? What non-edible items were used? What garnishes are used? How is each item placed? I am a big fan of fanning out ingredients around something round (like a bowl or a boursin cheese) and using lots of colours. Greens and reds are always very pleasing. Using accents like a large cut up grapefruit, coconut with raspberries inside, nuts and dried fruits can make a platter go from average to over the top. Remember, we are looking for dramatic difference in colour. Play around with where to put "brown" food like bread, crackers and other fillers. Some caterers use a ton of fillers like bread to cut down on costs but it's definitely a hard trick to master because it can make your platter very bland very quickly. A beginner trick is to use coloured crackers like beet crackers. I love having seasonal fruits/veggies on my boards, like a small pumpkin, pomegrantes, berries, large cut pineapple or papaya. Nature has so much beauty, use it! Head over to our safety and tips to get more tips and learn about the big no-nos. Also, head over to the gallery and be inspirated by the beauty of this unique art. And at last, check out our tutorials, instagram start and workshops to become an expert really quickly!

<!--    I know most people get very confused while on websites, especially if they are older and navigation always seems to be an issue so I thought i'll add cards to be permanently at the bottom of the page to act as a secondary navigation to the most popular pages: The tutorial, the Gallery and the Insta stars (I thought since these are in the Inspiration and maybe some might not be savy enough to navigate through it, then why not have it as cards, with attractive pictures and a very user friendly stretched link to encourage them to go to those pages. Setting the Cards as Rows was great because then I could control the size, the format and how I wanted them to look. on a phone it would be vertical and on a larger devide it would be vertical. I wanted it to be a stretched link because most people like to click on a picture instead of a specific button. I also gave each button a different colour so that it would pop and attract attention.-->

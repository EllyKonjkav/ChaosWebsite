<!--    I really wanted the Nav bar to be sticky so that anyone could navigate to any other page really easily and not have to scroll to the top to be able to get to another page. I also thought the dark background with white on top is easy to read and has the clean look that I was trying to achieve. I also made the Grazing Art linked to the home page. I made the Grazing Art to be always "active" (White). The page that the visitor is on will also become "active" and the rest to be muted so that they stand out.

            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the board  or surface that you are using is food safe. If it is not food safe, Put a food safe parchment paper before you place any food on it. </li>
                <li>Ask your geusts/clients about food allergies/restrictions. Are they allergic to nuts or Gluten or anything else? Do they only eat Halal food or keep kosher? Are they vegan or vegetarians?</li>
                <li>Use gloves while preparing anything before hand and make sure you are careful about cross contamination. Cover all food properly and use clean gloves while setting up. Change gloves during the set up to prevent cross contamination</li>
                <li>Do not work if you are sick and use a mask at all times while preparing and setting up</li>
                <li>Cheese and meat should not stay out in room temperature for more than 4 hours without extra care. One way is to place food safe ice plates under the cheese and cover it with some green to stretch that time frame.</li>
                <li>Do not mix moist food with dry food</li>
                <li>Do not place raw food next to other stuff</li>
                <li>NEVER put food outdoors during summer. This will reduce the safe time frame significantly</li>
                <li>Make sure to clearly lable allergies</li>
                <li>Put abundant serving utensils such as forks, spoons, thongs etc, to prevent anyone using their hands. If it's their first time, serve them to show them</li>
                <li>If you feel something has been contaminated while everyone is eating, stop them and discard that food and things around it</li>
                <li>Do not place hot food and cold food next to each other</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Colourful fruits, berries and veggies are your best friend. Purple cauliflower? Perfect! Small colourful peppers, coloured peppers, dried apricots and persimmon, Pomegranates, mangoes, red walnuts (Yes, they exist and they are delicious!), watermelon radishes, rainbow beets... </li>
                <li>Garnish all dips and solid coloured stuff like cheese, bread etc with something vibrant like rosemary, cherry tomatoes on the vine (or not), some berrie, etc.</li>
                <li>Figure out your style and build on it. Trust me, everyone has a style. Don't try to copy someone, learn from them and implement it into your own style.</li>
                <li>Prep everything before hand. It takes a LONG time to set up. Cut everything before hand, group them together and make it easy to see what you have on hand. I like to write out how I want to set it up (rough idea, because you never truly know until you do it)</li>
                <li>If you are doing a grazing table vs a grazing board, then ask someone to help you,  that works well with you! It's a lot of details and an extra pair of hands (or two) is a lifesaver</li>
                <li>Do not put food that needs to be served hot, it will make your life difficult. Try foods that are served cold or room temp.</li>
                <li>Cookies, especially if colourful, and elegant desserts will elevate your board. I love to have something sweet and something salty at the same time.</li>
                <li>Try to avoid lots of small finger foods (unless you have a lot of help) and try to minimize anything that needs a lot of last minute work/set up.</li>
                <li>Try to avoid ingredients that will go bad once out (avocadoes, bananas, peaches etc) but you can of course put lemon juice on them and use them if you insist</li>

<!--    I know most people get very confused while on websites, especially if they are older and navigation always seems to be an issue so I thought i'll add cards to be permanently at the bottom of the page to act as a secondary navigation to the most popular pages: The tutorial, the Gallery and the Insta stars (I thought since these are in the Inspiration and maybe some might not be savy enough to navigate through it, then why not have it as cards, with attractive pictures and a very user friendly stretched link to encourage them to go to those pages. Setting the Cards as Rows was great because then I could control the size, the format and how I wanted them to look. on a phone it would be vertical and on a larger devide it would be vertical. I wanted it to be a stretched link because most people like to click on a picture instead of a specific button. I also gave each button a different colour so that it would pop and attract attention.-->
